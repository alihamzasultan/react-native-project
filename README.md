# EDA Web App

## Project Overview

This project presents an advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) web application developed using Streamlit. The primary objective is to empower users with comprehensive data analysis capabilities, ranging from preprocessing to predictive modeling, all within an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
Effortlessly handle data preprocessing tasks such as missing value imputation, categorical variable encoding, feature scaling, and outlier detection to ensure data quality and robustness in subsequent analysis steps.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Unveil insights from your data through an array of statistical summaries, informative charts, and dynamic plots. Dive deep into your datasets to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns that drive meaningful business decisions.

### 3. Predictive Modeling:
Harness the power of machine learning by utilizing popular algorithms for predictive modeling and classification tasks. Empower decision-making with accurate predictions and actionable insights derived from state-of-the-art algorithms.

### 4. Interactive Visualization:
Experience data visualization like never before with interactive Plotly charts. Engage with your data dynamically, zooming, panning, and interacting with charts to uncover hidden trends and relationships effortlessly.
